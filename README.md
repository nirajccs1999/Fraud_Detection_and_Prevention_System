Fraud Detection and Prevention System is a data-driven project that aims to safeguard financial institutions and businesses from fraudulent activities. Fraudulent behavior poses significant risks, and detecting it in real-time is crucial to prevent financial losses and protect customer's assets.

This project utilizes a machine learning approach to develop an advanced fraud detection model. The model is designed to analyze transaction data, identify suspicious patterns, and proactively flag potential fraud attempts. By leveraging historical transaction information and relevant customer details, the system can predict and prevent fraudulent activities with high accuracy.
